It dod not had any idea about loki. I only knew that it is used to collect logs. so i decided to study about loki before setting it up.
i got to know that there are three ways by which it can be deployed and i decided to go with Simple Scalable Mode. Before setting Loki
i wanted to decide where two store logs. there were two options one is locally store on a server or use cloud. So decide to go with
cloud. Firstly i was going to use Miniio but it sets several pods on cluster which could have caused extra load on cluster. so i decided
to start with S3 bucket. so created a S3 bucket and Policy and also generated Access Key and Secret Access key.
