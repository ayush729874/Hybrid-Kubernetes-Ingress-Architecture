# Hybrid-Kubernetes-Ingress-Architecture
This project showcases a real-world hybrid architecture where a public cloud VM acts as an external load balancer, forwarding internet traffic to a private Kubernetes cluster. An NGINX Ingress Controller handles internal routing to services and pods, commonly used when direct public exposure of Kubernetes nodes is restricted.
